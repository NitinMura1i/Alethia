CUSTOMER PREPARATION GUIDES - Pinnacle Home Services

HOW TO PREPARE FOR A PLUMBING APPOINTMENT:
- Clear the area around the plumbing fixture that needs work (under sinks, around toilets, near water heater).
- Know where your main water shut-off valve is located (usually near the water meter or where the water line enters your home).
- If you have a specific faucet or fixture you'd like installed, have it ready for the technician.
- Remove any personal items from under sinks or around the work area.
- Make sure the technician has clear access to the area — move furniture or storage items if needed.
- Secure pets in a separate room during the appointment.

HOW TO PREPARE FOR AN ELECTRICAL APPOINTMENT:
- Know where your electrical panel (breaker box) is located.
- Make a note of which outlets, switches, or fixtures are having issues.
- If lights are flickering, note which rooms and how often.
- Clear access to the electrical panel — remove any items blocking it.
- The technician may need to turn off power to parts of your home temporarily.
- Unplug sensitive electronics (computers, TVs) in the areas being worked on.
- Secure pets in a separate room during the appointment.

HOW TO PREPARE FOR AN HVAC APPOINTMENT:
- Replace your air filter if it hasn't been changed in the last month (this helps the technician assess the system accurately).
- Clear at least 3 feet of space around your outdoor AC unit (remove plants, debris, storage items).
- Make sure the technician has clear access to your indoor unit and thermostat.
- Note any unusual sounds, smells, or behaviors from your system.
- If your system isn't cooling or heating, note when the issue started and if anything changed (new thermostat, power outage, etc.).
